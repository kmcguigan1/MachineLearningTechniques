R is correlation value, if its 1 or -1 then the values are strongly related if its close to zero there is low correlation.

What is R^2^ tho? it is more linear correlation than R, R2 of 0.7 is 1.4 times better than R2 of 0.5, this is not true for R

the variation of the data is sum of the squared y value minues mean value for each data point
